## File-Based

In lieu of a traditional database, this project employs a **file-based solution** for managing exercise data. This approach allows for quick access and manipulation of data without the need for a full database setup.

### How It Works:

- The exercise data is stored in memory using JavaScript data structures (like `Map` and `Set`), which are initialized once when the server starts. This means that the data is readily available for all API requests without reprocessing.
- The data is structured for efficient searching and retrieval, making it easy to filter and access exercises based on user preferences.

## Important Note

- The exercise assets (images) are cloned from an API on RapidAPI and are not owned by the project. They are utilized solely for personal use and demonstration purposesm, may allah bless him ^\_^
