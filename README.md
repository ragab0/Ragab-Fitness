## Technologies i used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- React
- Nextjs
- Tailwindcss
- Figma
- Rapid API;
- YoutTube API V3 (Not yet.. after getting a key we'll..);

## Feature
- Custom pagination
- Custom fetching APIs;
- Custom state management as i used useContext and useReducer;
- Creating an API endpoint in nextjs using the API routes and making requests to it using axios in fetching data;

## A Word
- It is not bad written code, 
- The exercisesdb API is not a free, SO i tried to found a way to clone it to my server and i did it in fact, and
now i can make any number of requests :DD; ***That doesn't mean its illegal doing, as i still use the main api**
 .. But since it was a challenge, it must have ended with the word **done!**
