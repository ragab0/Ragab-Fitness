## Techs and Tools

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- React
- Nextjs
- Tailwindcss
- Figma
- Rapid API;
- YoutTube API V3 (Not yet.. waiting getting a key as it isn't able for cloning such RapidAPI :DD; ..);

## Features
- Custom pagination
- Custom fetching APIs;
- Custom state management as i used useContext and useReducer;
- Creating an API endpoint in nextjs using the built-in nextjs API routes, and making requests to it using axios;

## A Word
- It is not bad written code, 
- The exercisesdb API is not mine, as I didn't clone it 100%; ***That doesn't mean its illegal doing, as i still use the main api**
 .. But since it was a challenge, have to be ended with **done!**
